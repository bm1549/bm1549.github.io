This is my personal site where I'll post about my interests or anything else I find fun. To start things off, I love code, cocktails, and corgis!

I current work as a software engineer at <a href="https://www.curalate.com/" target="_blank">Curalate</a> where I have a gentle balance of building out new features, scaling out our current services, and reducing our cost of goods sold.

At home, I really enjoy creating new and exciting cocktails. While I'm writing this, I'm drinking something I call [Too Matcha Vodka](/cocktails/2019/09/21/too-matcha-vodka.html). You can check out all of my recipes on the [cocktails](/cocktails) page.

When I'm not coding or crafting, I'm playing with my 2 year old corgi, Pumpkin! You can follow him on his <a href="https://www.instagram.com/whatsuppumpkin/" target="_blank">Instagram</a>!

I also graduated from <a href="https://nyu.edu/" target="_blank">NYU</a> with a major in Computer Science and my minors are in Physics and Mathematics. If you want someone to talk about superpositions or quantum computing, let me know.
